<p style="text-align: center;">
An extremely simple single-file static site generator written in Python in less than 300 lines of code.
</p>

## Why?

I was curious about how challenging it would be to build a very simple static site generator (spoiler: it's not very hard). I also wanted to experiment a bit with the concept of creating really simple, single-file scripts, with as few dependencies as possible that I could use with other tools whenever I needed to.

The end result is a very thin and opinionated layer of logic built on top of `Jinja2`.

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> You will be probably better of using a more mature tool like [hugo](https://gohugo.io).
